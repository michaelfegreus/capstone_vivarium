Another quiet day, wouldn't you say?
    -> It's a little too quiet for me here.
        Yes. It would be nice to see a little something change.
    -> I like the quiet.
        Well, I can't argue with that.

With those seeds, I could grow something pretty interesting in the fields.
Would you mind giving them to me?
    -> Yes, you can have them.

        Wonderful! I'll make plans to plant them in the morning.
    -> No, I think I'd like to hold onto them.
        Alright. Well, good luck with your quest.

Why, thank you!
With these strange little seeds, I think I can grow something rather fantastical in my fields.
I'll begin planting them in the morning.
Thank you, friend!

Thanks for helping me get my hands on these seeds.
These plants are going to be really special once they start to bloom.

Nice evening, isn't it.

I'm sorry you're stuck here.
But, it's nice to have some company.
